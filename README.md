# Installation Instructions

**NOTE: In order to install QuestCraft, you must have an Internet Connection in order for the inital setup to succeed. Furthermore, you MUST own a legal, valid copy of Minecraft: Java Edition to play!**

First, you need to install the QuestCraft APK to your VR Headset using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com) (available on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android) or with [QuestToolbox](https://github.com/mitchv2020/QuestToolbox) (Available on Windows, Auto Installer coming to QuestToolbox soon).

Next, open the QuestCraft launcher on your headset. Be sure to allow it to install any necessary files, and to grant it all requested permissions. Once complete, follow the on-screen prompts to enter your Minecraft login details and click the Install button to install QuestCraft's remaining required files.

And boom! You have successfully installed QuestCraft on your VR headset! To play, simply press the **Play** button and wait for it to load, it might take a while depending on headset age and model.

# Build Instructions

**NOTE: QuestCraft's current code is broken and therefore any attempt at building it manually, without modifying or adding to the current code, will result in a failure.**

For building manually, please check out our [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/PojavLauncher) repo and follow the instructions provided there. More in depth instructions for QCXR as a whole will be available soon.


## Recommended mods

QuestCraft is fairly slow by itself because minecraft is a very badly optimized game. Here is a (not comprehensive) list of some recommended performance enhancing mods:
- [Cull Leaves](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cull-leaves) (Culls leaves that are behind other leaves)
- [Starlight](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight) (Improves the lighting engine)
- [Lithium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium) (General purpose performance mod)

At the moment, Sodium, Iris, and Canvas do not work. We are working on porting sodium, if you would like to contribute, please make a PR for your work on our [Sodium](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/sodium-fabric) repo.
