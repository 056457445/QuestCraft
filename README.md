# CURRENTLY BROKEN BY THE META V44 UPDATE, PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ISSUES REGARDING THIS. A RELEASE INCLUDING THE FIX WILL BE OUT IN THE NEAR FUTURE (maybe)

# Welcome to the QuestCraft GitHub!
[Support us on Patreon!](https://patreon.com/QuestCraftXR)

~~First off, you most likely want to install QuestCraft. If you would like to get going instantly then please go to the release page for [QuestCraft](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/QuestCraft/releases/latest)and download the APK to your computer or mobile device.~~ **QuestCraft is currently broken due to the v44 update released by Meta, therefore all current releases are non-functional. A new release including the fix will be released at some point in the near future (hopefully).**

For our developer friends, the QuestCraft Source Code lies in both the [MCXR](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/MCXR) repo and [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/PojavLauncher) repo. These contain everything needed to compile QuestCraft from source.

**NOTE: QuestCraft version 3.0 will not be utilizing PojavLauncher + MCXR, but rather utilizing the recently released Vivecraft Mix-In project, which aims to make Vivecraft work without Optifine, therefore making it usable with the Fabric version of Minecraft.**

# Installation Instructions

**NOTE I: In order to install QuestCraft, you must have an Internet Connection in order for the inital setup to succeed. Furthermore, you MUST own a legal, valid copy of Minecraft: Java Edition to play!**

**NOTE II: These instructions only work if your Meta Quest is on Meta update v43 or below. Any update above v44 will not work for Questcraft due to Meta patching/removing a way that QuestCraft 2.0.1 and lower initalized from 2D to 3D, aka from PojavLauncher's main launcher to MCXR.**

First, you need to install the QuestCraft APK to your VR Headset using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com) (available on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android) or with [QuestToolbox](https://github.com/mitchv2020/QuestToolbox) (Available on Windows, Auto Installer coming to QuestToolbox soon).

Next, open the QuestCraft launcher on your headset. Be sure to allow it to install any necessary files, and to grant it all requested permissions. Once complete, follow the on-screen prompts to enter your Minecraft login details and click the Install button to install QuestCraft's remaining required files.

And boom! You have successfully installed QuestCraft on your VR headset! To play, simply press the **Play** button and wait for it to load, it might take a while depending on headset age and model.

# Build Instructions

**NOTE: QuestCraft's current code is broken and therefore any attempt at building it manually, without modifying or adding to the current code, will result in a failure.**

For building manually, please check out our [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/PojavLauncher) repo and follow the instructions provided there. More in depth instructions for QCXR as a whole will be available soon.


## Recommended mods

QuestCraft is fairly slow by itself because minecraft is a very badly optimized game. Here is a (not comprehensive) list of some recommended performance enhancing mods:
- [Cull Leaves](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cull-leaves) (Culls leaves that are behind other leaves)
- [Starlight](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight) (Improves the lighting engine)
- [Lithium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium) (General purpose performance mod)

At the moment, Sodium, Iris, and Canvas do not work. We are working on porting sodium, if you would like to contribute, please make a PR for your work on our [Sodium](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/sodium-fabric) repo.
